# Etch-A-Sketch

## Introduction
As part of my self-driven effort to learn web development, I built a digital Etch-A-Sketch using pure HTML/CSS and Javascript.

An [Etch-A-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) is a children's toy that creates drawings by drawing magnets through aluminum powder.

You can try the Etch-A-Sketch for yourself [here](https://nbestauros.github.io/Etch-A-Sketch/).


## What I Learned
### HTML
Created an input element to allow a user to specifiy Etch-A-Sketch grid size.
### CSS
Utilized CSS grids to arrange the Etch-A-Sketch drawing window, and flexbox to arrange the website's title and input items.
### Javascript
Used javascript to redraw grids of varying sizes based on user input by changing css style variables, and to handle Etch-A-Sketch drawing logic by using Event Listeners.
